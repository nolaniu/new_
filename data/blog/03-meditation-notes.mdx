# Meditation Space

When study fatigue sets in and you need a moment to reset, the **Meditation Space** is here for you.  
You can find the entrance at **Focus Space → Meditation Space**.  
By default, the scene **“Twilight over the Hills”** will load automatically, along with matching ambient audio that loops in the background.  
You can switch tracks anytime to create the atmosphere you need.

---

## Backgrounds and Ambient Audio

On the left side, you’ll see the first **rounded control button**. It has two parts:

- **Speaker Icon** → click to mute or restore audio.  
- **Label Text** → click to cycle through three backgrounds:  
  - 🌲 Forest Morning Mist  
  - 💧 Mountain Stream  
  - 🌅 Twilight over the Hills  

When you switch, both the background image and audio update together to match the chosen scene.

## Meditation Overlay

Next, you’ll notice the **Fast Meditation / Finish** button.  
This controls the **meditation overlay**:

- **Open** → shows the overlay with breathing guidance.  
- **Close** → hides the overlay, stops the session timer, and resets the breathing animation.  

---

## Breathing Cycle

When the overlay is open, a **central breathing circle** expands and contracts according to an **11-second cycle**:

- Inhale → 4 seconds  
- Hold → 1 second  
- Exhale → 6 seconds  

Use the control buttons below:

- **Start** → begin a 60-second session  
- **Pause** → stop the cycle mid-session  
- **Reset** → return to the initial state and restart the animation  

---

## Visual Cues

Beneath the breathing circle:

- A **capsule text** displays real-time breathing instructions (e.g. *Inhale, Hold, Exhale*).  
- A **gradient progress bar** tracks the overall 60-second session.  

At the end of the session, the cycle automatically returns to the **inhale phase** and pauses.  
You can then choose **Reset** to start over, or **Finish** to close the overlay.

### In Summary

The Meditation Space is designed to give you a quick reset whenever you need it.  
With calming visuals, looping ambient sounds, and a gentle breathing rhythm, you can step away from mental fatigue—even for just one minute.  

Use it between Pomodoro sessions, at the end of a study block, or anytime you want to restore clarity and focus.
